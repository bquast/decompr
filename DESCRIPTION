Title: Global Value Chain Decomposition
Description: Three global value chain (GVC) decompositions are implemented. 
    The Leontief decomposition derives the value added origin of exports by 
    country and industry as in Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001). The Koopman, 
    Wang and Wei (2014) decomposition splits country-level exports into 9 
    value added components, and the Wang, Wei and Zhu (2013) decomposition 
    splits bilateral exports into 16 value added components. Various GVC 
    indicators based on these decompositions are computed in the 
    complimentary 'gvc' package.
